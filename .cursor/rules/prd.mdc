---

## 3. Core User Flow

### Ritual 1: Burn Anxiety (Free)
1. Home screen → choose **Burn Anxiety**.  
2. Input worry → tap **Release**.  
3. Animation: text chars, fades, turns to ash, drifts away.  
4. Closing screen: *“It’s released. Rest now.”*

### Ritual 2: Store Positivity (Premium)
1. Home screen → choose **Store Positivity**.  
2. Input positive thought → tap **Plant**.  
3. Animation: text transforms into glowing seed/lantern, floats away.  
4. Thought saved in local CoreData database.  
5. User can revisit stored thoughts in a simple list view (“Garden of Positivity”).

## 4. Features (MVP)

### Must-Have
- Gradient dark background (indigo → black).  
- Text input with glowing buttons (Release / Plant).  
- Burn animation with ash particle effect.  
- Store animation with seed/lantern effect.  
- CoreData storage for positive thoughts.  
- View stored thoughts in simple list.  
- Offline-first (no backend, no accounts).  

### Nice-to-Have (Phase 2)
- Alternative animations (water dissolve, wind, floating paper lanterns).  
- Soundscapes (fire crackle, ocean waves, soft chimes).  
- Settings toggle for sound + haptics.  
- Subscription monetization: $2.99/month or $19.99/year.  

---

## 5. Non-Goals (MVP)
- No social features.  
- No text saving for “Burn” ritual (must disappear permanently).  
- No cloud sync or analytics.  

---

## 6. UX / UI Requirements

### Visual Style
- Minimal, dark, soothing.  
- Large readable fonts.  
- Indigo, violet, ember-orange accent.  
- Smooth, slow animations (easeInOut, 5–7 sec cycles).  

### Accessibility
- High-contrast text.  
- Support for Dynamic Type.  
- Optional haptic feedback when rituals start.  

---

## 7. Technical Requirements
- **Language:** Swift + SwiftUI.  
- **Animations:** Core Animation / Canvas / SpriteKit (for particles).  
- **Persistence:** CoreData for PositiveThought entity (`id: UUID, text: String, date: Date`).  
- **Offline-first:** All features work without internet.  
- **App Size:** <100MB.  

---

## 8. Monetization (Planned Phase 2)
- Free core ritual: Burn Anxiety.  
- Premium: Store Positivity + extra animations/sounds.  
- Subscription: $2.99/month, $19.99/year.  
- No ads (to maintain calm/healer vibe).  

---

## 9. Success Metrics
- Downloads (goal: 10k in first 6 months).  
- Retention: % of users performing a ritual 3+ nights/week.  
- Conversion: 3–5% of users subscribe to Premium.  
- Revenue: Target $10k MRR within 12–18 months.
