# 🎥 Video Debug Guide - Black Screen Fix

## 🔍 **Current Status: Black Screen (Progress!)**

Good news! The black screen means:
- ✅ Container is rendering
- ✅ Video file is found
- ✅ Player is being created
- ❌ Video content not displaying

## 🧪 **Enhanced Debugging Added**

I've added comprehensive debugging to identify the exact issue. Now when you test, you'll see:

### **Expected Console Output:**
```
🎬 RealAnimationContainer appeared with type: video, file: fire_background
🎬 Rendering Video: fire_background
🎥 Setting up video: fire_background
✅ Video file found: /path/to/fire_background.mp4
📊 Video file size: 89.3 MB
📐 Player layer frame: (0.0, 0.0, 393.0, 852.0)
📐 Player layer added to view layer
▶️ Video playback started
✅ Video ready to play
✅ Video is playing (rate: 1.0)
```

### **If Video Fails:**
```
❌ Video failed to load: [error message]
⚠️ Video is not playing (rate: 0.0)
```

## 🚀 **Test Steps:**

1. **Build and run** your app
2. **Click Fire ritual**
3. **Check console** for the debug messages above
4. **Tell me what you see** - this will pinpoint the exact issue

## 🔧 **Possible Issues & Solutions:**

### **Issue 1: Video Format**
- **Problem**: Video codec not supported
- **Solution**: Convert to H.264 MP4
- **Check**: Look for "Video failed to load" message

### **Issue 2: File Size**
- **Problem**: Video too large (89MB is quite large)
- **Solution**: Compress video to <10MB
- **Check**: Look for file size in logs

### **Issue 3: Frame Size**
- **Problem**: Player layer has zero frame
- **Solution**: Fixed with layoutSubviews override
- **Check**: Look for frame dimensions in logs

### **Issue 4: Playback Rate**
- **Problem**: Video not actually playing
- **Solution**: Check video format and codec
- **Check**: Look for "rate: 0.0" vs "rate: 1.0"

## 🎯 **Quick Test:**

If you want to test with a smaller video:
1. **Find a small MP4** (<5MB)
2. **Rename it** to `fire_background.mp4`
3. **Replace** your current video
4. **Test again**

## 📱 **Fallback System:**

If video fails completely, you should see:
- **White text** saying "Video not available - Using fallback animation"
- **SwiftUI animation** should start instead

## 🆘 **Next Steps:**

1. **Run the test** and check console logs
2. **Share the console output** with me
3. **I'll identify the exact issue** and provide a fix

The enhanced debugging will tell us exactly what's happening! 🔍
